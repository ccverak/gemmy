## Precaution
*This is a personal project, it was used on my previous job about a year ago with no problem, despite of that is not recommended to use it on production, you are warned!.*

*The only objective of this project is to have some sample source, but who knows it might be useful in the feature.*

## Test coverage
Believe or not I lost the tests from this project, this is a deployment copy.

## Licence
